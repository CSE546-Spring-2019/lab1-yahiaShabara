There has been plenty of speculation surrounding the future of Paris Saint-Germain striker Edinson Cavani since Neymar and Kylian Mbappe arrived in 2017. Now, the Express are linking the Uruguay international with Chelsea, who themselves have struggled up front this season.

The 31-year-old has scored 324 goals in 519 appearances for the Ligue 1 side, while Maurizio Sarri has reportedly lost faith in his own strikers - Olivier Giroud and Alvaro Morata - who have scored just six Premier League goals between them this season.
